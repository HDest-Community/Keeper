### Notes
- The following stats are restored (by default):
	- 60% of bleeding, wounds, aggro, burns, bloodloss, and diseases (if applicable);
- CVars are:
	- `keeper_percent_* [0.0 - 1.0]`: Sets the percentage of stats restored on respawn, where * is one of the following: `bleeding`, `wounds`, `burns`, `aggro`, `bloodloss`, `diseases`.

### Warning
- If you set bleeding to anything above 0, **do not bandage**. Tell your teammates to use a medikit. Bandaging results in Wounds Already Treated accumulating STUPIDLY fast and will likely result in you crawling around for the rest of the level. This mod can be brutal. Use with care!
