### Notes
- The following stats are restored (by default):
	- 60% of blues;
	- 60% of aggro;
	- 60% of burns;
	- 60% of bloodloss;
- CVars are:
	- `keeper_percent_* [0.0 - 1.0]`: Sets the percentage of stats restored on respawn, where * is `blues`, `burns`, `aggro`, or `bloodloss`. For bloodloss, setting it to anything over 0 will override Power of Friendship's forced bloodloss.
